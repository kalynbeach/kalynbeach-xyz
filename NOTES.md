### ðŸ”’ Auth

> Implement authentication using `next-auth`.

#### Auth Concepts

- **Authentication**
  - Verifies if the user is who they say they are.
  - Requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.
- **Session Management**
  - Tracks the user's state (e.g. logged in) across multiple requests.
- **Authorization**
  - Decides what parts of the application the user is allowed to access.

#### Authorization "Zones"

- **Public**
  - Default for all routes
- **Shared**
  - Matched to specific routes
  - For pages and content meant to be shared with specific people
  - Passwordless/token-based authentication
    - Maybe credentials-based login, initially
- **Admin**
  - Matched to specific routes
  - For `kalynbeach` (and any other admins) only
  - OAuth/OpenID Connect-based authentication
    - Probably using the GitHub provider initially
